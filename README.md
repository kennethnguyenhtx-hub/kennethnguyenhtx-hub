# Hi, I'm Kenneth 👋

I'm a data analyst building projects that tackle real-world problems using data extraction, analysis, and visualization. These projects develop my analytical toolkit: pulling data from APIs, building Python ETL pipelines, writing SQL queries, and creating dashboards that turn raw data into actionable insights.

- Cloud dependency grew from 62% (2020) to 77.6% (2025)
- Single AWS outage put $2.5B+ in revenue at risk

**Tech Stack:**

`Python` · `SEC EDGAR API` · `yfinance` · `MySQL` · `Power BI` · `ETL Pipeline`
